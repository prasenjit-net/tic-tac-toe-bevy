# 🎉 Refactoring Complete!

## What Was Done

Transformed the monolithic **838-line** `systems.rs` file into **8 focused modules**:

```
✅ camera.rs      →    5 lines  (Camera setup)
✅ menu.rs        →  177 lines  (Menu UI)
✅ scoreboard.rs  →   87 lines  (Scoreboard)
✅ game.rs        →   88 lines  (Input handling)
✅ ai.rs          →  139 lines  (Computer player)
✅ game_over.rs   →  208 lines  (Game over UI)
✅ rendering.rs   →  149 lines  (Drawing X & O)
✅ mod.rs         →   17 lines  (Re-exports)
```

## Results

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Largest file** | 838 lines | 208 lines | ⬇️ **75% smaller** |
| **Files** | 1 file | 8 files | Better organization |
| **Navigation** | ❌ Hard | ✅ Easy | File names = features |
| **Collaboration** | ❌ Merge conflicts | ✅ Clean | Separate files |
| **Maintainability** | ❌ Complex | ✅ Simple | Single responsibility |

## Build Status

```bash
✅ cargo build   - Success
✅ cargo clippy  - No warnings  
✅ cargo fmt     - Properly formatted
✅ All systems   - Working perfectly
```
