# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Enhancement - Completed ‚úÖ

## Summary
Successfully enhanced the Bevy tic-tac-toe game with the following features:

## ‚ú® New Features

### 1. **Player Selection Menu**
- Menu screen appears on game startup
- Four game mode options:
  - Human vs Human
  - Human vs Computer (Easy)
  - Human vs Computer (Hard)
  - Computer vs Computer
- Clean, centered UI with interactive buttons

### 2. **AI Players**
Two difficulty levels implemented:

**Easy Mode:**
- Randomly selects from available moves
- Good for beginners

**Hard Mode:**
- Strategic AI with the following priority:
  1. Try to win if possible
  2. Block opponent from winning
  3. Take center square
  4. Take a corner
  5. Take any available square
- Provides a challenging opponent

### 3. **Computer Player Delay**
- Random delay between 200-800ms before AI makes a move
- Makes the game feel more natural and allows player to see board state
- Configurable via the `ComputerMoveTimer` resource

### 4. **Scoreboard Overlay**
- Persistent scoreboard in the top-left corner
- Shows:
  - Player X type (e.g., "Human", "Computer Easy", "Computer Hard")
  - Player O type
  - Cumulative statistics: X Wins, O Wins, Draws
- Scoreboard persists across multiple games
- Only resets when returning to menu

### 5. **Game Over Screen**
- Appears when game ends (win or draw)
- Shows appropriate message:
  - "Player X Wins!"
  - "Player O Wins!"
  - "It's a Draw!"
- Two buttons:
  - **New Game (R)**: Start a new game with same players, scores persist
  - **Back to Menu (Esc)**: Return to player selection, scores reset

### 6. **Keyboard Controls**
- **R key**: Start a new game (works during play or at game over)
- **Esc key**: Return to menu from playing state

### 7. **State Management**
- Proper Bevy state system implementation
- Two states: `Menu` and `Playing`
- Clean transitions with proper cleanup
- Systems only run when appropriate state is active

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. **Cargo.toml**: Added `rand = "0.8"` dependency
2. **components.rs**: Added UI components and PlayerType enum
3. **state.rs**: Added AppState, PlayerConfig, Score, ComputerMoveTimer resources
4. **systems.rs**: Added menu, AI, scoreboard, and game over systems
5. **mod.rs**: Configured state-based system scheduling

### Key Systems:
- `spawn_menu`: Creates menu UI
- `handle_menu_buttons`: Processes menu interactions
- `computer_player`: AI logic with random delay
- `spawn_scoreboard`: Creates persistent score display
- `update_scoreboard`: Updates scores when games end
- `show_game_over_ui`: Displays game over screen
- `handle_game_over_buttons`: Handles new game/menu navigation
- `keyboard_controls`: Keyboard shortcuts
- `cleanup_menu` / `cleanup_game`: State transition cleanup

### Resources:
- `AppState`: Menu | Playing
- `GameState`: Current board state
- `PlayerConfig`: X and O player types
- `Score`: Win/draw statistics
- `ComputerMoveTimer`: AI move delay timer

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Start the game**: Run `cargo run`
2. **Select game mode**: Click one of the four options
3. **Play**: Click cells to make moves (if human player)
4. **Watch AI**: Computer players move automatically after a delay
5. **Game over**: Choose to play again or return to menu
6. **Keyboard shortcuts**: Press R for new game, Esc for menu
